[CustomerController](Hedgehog_UI_Views_Store_CustomerController.md 'Hedgehog.UI.Views.Store.CustomerController')

A class for handling login, registration and settings pages of customers.  
  
Note that the login and registration are adapted from the scaffolded Razor pages. This was done in orde  
to learn how they work, thus there is some duplication going on.
